<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Spiderman: Into the Spider-Verse</h3>
<p>I love the jokes and other portrayals of different Spider-Men</p>
<h3>Thor: Ragnarok</h3>
<p>I love the emotion and events that occur in this movie. I also like the puns that appear in every scene.</p>
<h3>Avengers: Endgame</h3>
<p>The film has a sense of grandeur that most other Marvel films try to replicate but fail at it almost every time.</p>
